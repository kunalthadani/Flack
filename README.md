# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My project is a chat application. Once a user visits the website he needs to enter a display name.
He can then message on any channel or ping any other user.

In the templates folder there are 2 HTML files
channel.html has the html framework of my app
login.html is a page where the user enters his display name.
In the static folder:
there are two stylesheets style.css and style1.css
there is a javascript file script.js that is used to send ajax requests and for sockets 
there is an image logo.jpg which is the logo displayed on the login page.

My additional feature is that a user can "ping" or say hi to any other registered user.
